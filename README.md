R-PROJECTinDatavisualization--CrimeagainstWomen

INTRODUCTION  
#The country where we worship goddess is also the worst country for women. Crime against women reported every two minutes over the last decade.
The main agenda of this project is to analyze crime data by following all the steps required for the complete data visualization.
Throughout this article, we will try to see if at all there is a reduction in crimes as the year count increases. We will visualize each column of data (mentioned above) state-wise & year-wise, and thus explore in a much better way.
